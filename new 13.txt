Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally escalate my complaint regarding the non-delivery of my passport, which was dispatched through India Post and routed via the R T Nagar Delivery Centre. The delivery attempt was incorrectly marked as "Address Left – Return to Sender" on 11/12/2025. This entry in the tracking system is factually inaccurate and has caused significant distress, inconvenience, and delay in the receipt of my passport, which is a vital government-issued identity document.

I wish to place on record the following facts for your immediate attention:

1. The address provided in my passport application and registered with India Post is accurate, valid, and has been used for other official communications without issue. There is no discrepancy in the address details, and therefore the reason cited for non-delivery cannot be attributed to incorrect address information.

2. On the date of delivery, I was physically present at the given address. I had specifically ensured my availability because I was aware of the importance of receiving the passport in person. As per the rules, I am the only authorized person to collect the passport, and I was ready with the necessary identification to complete the delivery process.

3. Despite my presence, the postman did not deliver the passport to me. The delivery was wrongly marked as "Address Left," which is misleading and incorrect. This suggests either negligence or a procedural lapse on the part of the delivery staff. Such errors compromise the integrity of the delivery process and cause unnecessary hardship to citizens.

4. The passport is a critical document required for identification, travel, and legal purposes. Any delay in its receipt directly impacts my ability to fulfill personal, professional, and legal obligations. The wrongful marking of the delivery status has not only delayed the process but has also forced me to spend additional time and effort in raising complaints and seeking resolution.

In light of the above, I request immediate corrective action on the following points:

- Kindly release the passport to me at the earliest. I am willing to collect it directly from the R T Nagar Delivery Centre if re-delivery is not feasible. Please ensure that the document is handed over to me without further delay.

- Conduct a thorough investigation into why the delivery was wrongly marked as "Address Left – Return to Sender" despite my availability. This will help identify whether the lapse was due to negligence, miscommunication, or procedural error.

- Implement corrective measures to prevent such incidents in the future. Citizens should not be subjected to unnecessary stress and delays due to avoidable errors in the delivery process, especially when dealing with sensitive documents like passports.

I trust that the authorities will treat this matter with the urgency it deserves. The passport is not just another postal item; it is a crucial document that enables individuals to exercise their rights and responsibilities. I therefore request that this grievance be prioritized and resolved without further delay.

Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and confirm the steps being taken to resolve the issue. I am available for any clarification or verification required to facilitate the resolution.

Sincerely,
